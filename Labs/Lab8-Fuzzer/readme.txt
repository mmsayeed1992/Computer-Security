Briefly explain what this tool is (that is, an overview).
- This is a XSS scanner that look for vulnerability on a website (http://www.cs.tufts.edu/comp/120/hackme.php?token=Foodler).

Briefly explain how the tool works.
- First we get all the form for user-input in Javascript code.
- Then we get all the useful information from these user-input fields or forms
- Then we submit these forms with a value or text, depending on form method
- If Javascript code submission is successful then there is a clear sign of XSS vulnerability, as True or otherwise False.
