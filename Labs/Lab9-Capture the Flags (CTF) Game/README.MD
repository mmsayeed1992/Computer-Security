Objectives
Find vulnerabilities in web application(s) and then take advantage of them.
Overview
In this traditional game, you will be finding and exploiting vulnerabilities in a series of applications, mainly web, to gain access to information you should not have access to. The goal is to find the "flags" placed on the server or servers. As in the past, I will tell you how many flags I have planted. I will also provide an obscure hint for each of them.

Instructions
You will have one week to play the game.

Logistics
Teams will be created, and submission keys will be distributed to each team by Monday, March 22nd
CTF game opens on Thursday, March 25th at 4:30 PM Eastern Time
CTF game closes on Friday, April 2nd at 11:59 PM Pacific Time
CTF write-up due, in PDF format, on Monday, April 5th at 11:59 PM Pacific Time. One submission per team.  No grace period.
Lab 10, which depends on the source code of the CTF game, opens on Tuesday, April 6th in the morning
A Flag
In the style of many Security Capture The Flag games, the format of a flag will look like this: key{flag}. Examples: key{somelongstringthatrepresentshteflag} or key{334359b051f4dda20937055605b3706dfe91d6c8}"). Each flag will worth a certain value: 100 points, 200 points, 300, and 400 points. You will be given a unique key to submit flags, to be posted in Canvas under your grading for this lab.

Scoring
There will be a scoreboard. The scoreboard will display a hint for each flag, and the scores for each player. This is also where you will submit flags. The scoreboard is available at http://35.223.71.79/scoreboardLinks to an external site..

Assessment
There will be two components for grading:

Your team's score for the game (15 points)
Your team's CTF writeup (15 points)
Ground Rules
Should you tamper with the scoreboard or flag submission system, 100 points will be deducted from your score for each attempt.
Preparing to Play
It is important that you tinker with the applications.
Use your creativity. That is, if you were an attacker, what would do?
Be sure to view the source of all the web pages and relevant files.
For some challenges (flags), some programming or scripting may be necessary.
Resources that would be ideal to have for the game: SQL reference, a proxy (e.g., Burp Suite), Kali Linux. You are encouraged to use tools that are on Kali Linux.
The CTF Write-Up
Your team will produce a write-up that is submitted electronically in PDF format, one submission per team.

So what constitutes a good CTF write-up? For each flag that you finds, the following information should be provided:

A screenshot of the flag
The exact location of the flag (path or file name)
The exploit or methodology used to find the flag
In addition, an Executive Summary, Lessons Learned, and Conclusion sections are necessary.

A good example of a CTF write-up is https://s0cket7.com/picoctf-web/Links to an external site. (Pico CTF 2018 Web Exploitation Writeup). A list of CTF write-ups can be found at https://ctftime.org/writeupsLinks to an external site. and at https://github.com/VulnHub/ctf-writeupsLinks to an external site..
