Part 1, The Basics
Because this is largely a hands-on course, it is essential that you learn many of the fundamental Linux commands, an important skill for any good security practitioner.

If you are using macOS, you can also use the Terminal app. If you are using Windows 10, you can use the Linux subsystem. See instructions at https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10Links to an external site.. You are encouraged to use the Kali Linux virtual machine for this lab (https://comp116.org/kalivm.htmlLinks to an external site.).

Please learn and tinker with the commands below and answer the questions below. Many commands will require flags.

Answer the questions below, submit via Canvas.
How would you find the path to the python command?

How would you download a file from the Internet?
What command can you use to find out your IP address and MAC address?

What command can you use to show all the processes that are running on the system?

What command can you use to get more details about running processes listening on ports?

Assume you found a file named warrent.pdf. What command could you use to find out what type of file this was?

So you discovered that warrent.pdf is a binary executable. What command could you use to extract any readable information from the file without running it? Also, try this on a compressed file such a ZIP or JAR

What command can you use to find the IP address-to-MAC address mappings for systems on the local network?

Consider the following IP address: 5[dot]188[dot]86[dot]172. Where is the computer with that IP address located --in what country?

For the previous question, what command did you use to determine the location of the computer?

What command can you use to securely delete a file?

What command can you use to see if you are a computer administrator or superuser?

What command can you use to see list of previous commands you have entered on command line?

What command can you use to see list of scheduled tasks running on your computer?

Part 2, Wargames
Let's further hone your basic security skills by playing wargames. This set of wargames is offered by OverTheWire (http://overthewire.org/wargames/Links to an external site.).

Play the Bandit wargame at http://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/Links to an external site., beginning with level 0. Play as many levels as you can. To get credit, show proof that you have played the Bandit wargames by uploading a screenshot of the highest level you have completed.

This part is dedicated to Olivia MacDougal, Class of 2018
