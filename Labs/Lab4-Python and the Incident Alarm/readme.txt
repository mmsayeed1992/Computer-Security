The README File

Identify what aspects of the work have been correctly implemented and what have not.
-/All should work correctly

Identify anyone with whom you have collaborated or discussed the assignment.
-/Piazza, google (stackflow), Kunal Mehta

Say approximately how many hours you have spent completing the assignment.
-/8 to 10 hours

List any additional dependencies used.
-/No dependencies

Are the heuristics used in this assignment to determine incidents "even that good"?
-/It does not do anything to prevent attack, therefore it is limited. These alarm can also create noise for the cyber prevention team, can have false positives or disastrous attack hidden in plain sight. In addition, the limited number of heuristics used limits the abilities to detect incidents because many incidents are not covered, such as attempts at SQL injection or other malicious activity.

If you have spare time in the future, what would you add to the program or do differently with regards to detecting incidents?
-/I would work on prioritization of attacks and their alarm in many different contexts, such as traffic vs load vs ddos vs dollar value impact.
-/I would also look at implementing detectors for other scans, and look at server data to make sure the web pages visited were not downloading unwanted data.
-/I would also keep a log of attacking IP's for future data usage. This way we can possible blacklist such IPs
