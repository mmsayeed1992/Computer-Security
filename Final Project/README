Cloud Technology’s Risk Assessment

Abstract:
Over the last two decades, many organizations have utilized cloud technology to modernize their core strategy, while individual consumers have used it for convenience. There is a vast amount of services that the cloud has helped with thus far, such as storing data, scale internal services, or simply using for its computing power. However, little can be said about the risk of cloud technology. This paper will explore the risk assessment of cloud technology as it pertains to internet space and cyber security phenomena. Many cloud companies - such as AWS, Azure, Google and many others - are offering cloud-based applications to their clientele as a SaaS, but what are the security risks and what can we do to mitigate them? Web-based applications are used to access the cloud, but these web-based applications may include their own vulnerabilities. Furthermore, with an abundance of user data used by organizations, who’s responsible for information hijacking? In an attempt to answer the above questions, we can better understand cloud technology’s security risk and take further actions to mitigate these risks in accordance with the CIA triad.
